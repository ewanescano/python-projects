# Python
I showcase Python project I made with Datacamp to deepen my expertise with key libraries such as: 
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Scikit-Learn
  - Seaborn

Through these projects, Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience in data manipulation, visualization, and foundational machine learning techniques. Each project represents my commitment to transforming raw data into actionable insights, refining my analytical skills, and delivering meaningful results.
